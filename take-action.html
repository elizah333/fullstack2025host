          <aside> <p>WWF works on jaguar conservation across Latin America, from the Amazon rainforest and the Pantanal wetlands to the dry forests of Central America. These landscapes are not only vital for jaguars but also home to millions of people and countless other species that depend on healthy ecosystems.  
</p><p>
Out of these key landscapes, several are priority restoration areas where WWF and partners are working with governments and local communities to reconnect fragmented habitats, secure migration corridors, and bring jaguars back to areas where they have disappeared.  
</p><p>
WWF also tackles wider threats beyond these landscapes — from the illegal wildlife trade and poaching, to deforestation, infrastructure development, and conflicts with humans and livestock.

            <h2>Adopt a Jaguar</h2>
            <div class="intro-text">
                  <p>
      The three jaguars who symbolically represent our adoptions were among the 
      first jaguars ever photographed by our camera traps, and like all wild jaguars, 
      they led solitary and elusive lives. Their descendants are among the last 
      jaguars to freely roam South America today.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you adopt Luna, Kael, or Sombra you’re making a symbolic but incredibly 
      powerful gesture to protect the rainforest their descendants now rely on for 
      survival. By adopting one jaguar, you’re helping to safeguard this small but 
      critical population and actively protect their habitat against poachers, 
      logging, and illegal encroachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your adoption will start working immediately, supporting vigilant Wildlife 
      Protection Units to patrol protected habitats day and night, deterring 
      poachers, untangling snares, and guarding against illegal logging. Just as 
      important, your protection extends to all native species, making sure the 
      jaguars under your protection have a steady source of prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaguars are elusive predators that live mostly solitary lives. Their needs 
      can only be met in the wild, in their natural environment. This is the goal 
      of our Jaguar Adoption Program. Thank you for being a part of it.

                <p>Luna lives deep within the Amazon Basin, a breeding female who carefully guards her territory. Already producing two successful cubs these last seasons.
      She depends on intact rainforest corridors to raise her cubs and protect them from threats. </p><p>
      Illegal logging and poaching are constant dangers, but with your support we can safeguard her home 
      and ensure she has the resources to continue to thrive.<em>Can you help her?</em></p>

                <p>Kael is a young male roaming the Pantanal Wetlands. He requires abundant prey and vast forest to survive, yet human encroachment is shrinking his range. </p><p>
      He is in search of his own territory but with the decreasing liveable areas it's proving a hard task. Supporting Sombra means protecting not just one jaguar but an entire ecosystem that depends on his presence. <em>Can you help him?</em></p>

                <p>Sombra, a dominant male in the Guyana Shield, plays a vital role in maintaining balance across his territory. He faces the challenge of crossing fragmented landscapes where roads and ranches divide his path. </p><p>
      By adopting Kael, you help protect safe migration corridors so he can establish his range and 
      contribute to the future jaguar population. This is vital for his lineage. <em>Can you help him?</em></p>
